## About The Project

Partograph is a composite graphical record where measurements related to maternal and fetal data including uterine contraction, cervical dilatation, fetal heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, descent of head, color of membrane and liquor, moulding of fetal skull bones, duration of labor, are plotted manually.

PartoCalc is an automated partograph generator mobile app that is operated by voice command. The app is intended for the use of nurses during the childbirth of pregnant mothers. This project was funded by [Terre des hommes](https://www.tdh.ch/en).
